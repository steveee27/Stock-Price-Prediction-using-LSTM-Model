# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-LSTM-Model
This project implements a LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to predict stock prices of AAPL (Apple Inc.) and AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) using historical data. The dataset includes stock prices with features like Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume. The model is trained using LSTM to learn the temporal dependencies in the data.
